## Dewees Creek to North Santee River

Today we arrived in Georgetown, SC. We spent two more days motoring up the ICW to get here from our previous anchorage. The journey was mostly uneventful. We left Dewees Creek at 11am on a falling tide expecting a long day of motoring. We were right. The passage itself was mostly uneventful with only a few shallow points where we had to slow down.

It was beautiful but we really only got to enjoy it when the other person was at the helm. We're still very new to the boat and the amount of focus while at the helm can become tiring. The decision was made the previous night to switch off every 2 hours and we mostly kept to that schedule.

The original float plan had us arriving at our anchorage at the North Santee River at 7pm. With some favorable winds and currents we arrived slightly earlier at 6:30pm. We've found that an average of 5 miles an hour is right for SV Patience.

The forecast called for heavier gusts in the evening so we wanted to find a good spot with some cover to drop anchor. Unfortunately the area is mostly flat and treeless with only small clumps of trees on the shores. Thankfully the river is very wide so we could let out more chain if we felt it was getting too windy. After motoring around inspecting the area for a little we found a larger clump of trees that, while not great, we thought might provide some wind cover.

Dropping the anchor this time around went much smoother. We learned from our mistakes the previous night and set the anchor firmly on the first try. We spent the next hour or so relaxing and unwinding while keeping anchor watch.

The next day would see us arrive in Georgetown and would be much shorter; roughly 4 hours. The passage to Georgetown was expected to be uneventful again however our anchorage at Georgetown would have some narrow shallows that would need to be navigated carefully. In addition Cassandra would need to work in the afternoon. All this meant we would need to leave early the next morning to have enough time to find a decent anchorage.

Dinner was a delicious noodly concoction.

## North Santee to Georgetown, SC

We left the North Santee River at 8:30am. Lifting anchor was uneventful. The first half of our passage saw us making our way up the ICW until we reached Winyah Bay. This was very similar to our previous day's passage and was mostly straightforward. There was a swing bridge about halfway up that sees irregular use. We would have had to stop for it to allow traffic if it had been closed but luckily it was not. At the entrance to Winyah Bay we passed several dolphins playing and eating. We took it as a good omen.

The journey up Winyah Bay was calm. About halfway up our route we joined with the shipping lanes so we had an eye out for any container ships or large vessels but it was clear. Getting into Georgetown was a little more hair raising.

The town of Georgetown is on a horseshoe inlet with an island in the middle. The passage is not very wide and it gets very shallow near the island so you have to hug the mainland. In addition there are a number of old deck pylons sticking out of the water. I stayed at the helm with binoculars calling out obstacles. Cassandra stayed at the helm to steer us in with the depth charts. We were going so slow a strong wind would have pushed us backwards. But we made it in without incident.

We chose an anchorage near the top of the horseshoe, near the old steel mill. Tomorrow there will be shifting winds so we wanted to take that into account when selecting where to drop anchor. Near the entrance to Georgetown there were quite a few boats at anchor already. We didn't want to park too close to them in case of shifting winds. It would also limit our ability to let our more chain if we felt it necessary. We ended up finding a nice open area with plenty of room to swing and dropped anchor. At this point we were pros. The anchor set quickly and we kept a anchor watch for an hour or so to check for drag.

Dinner was a tasty carnita frittata.

We'll stay at anchor for the next two nights before heading to the marina. We'll be at the Marina until Friday then start making our way past Myrtle Beach and into North Carolina.
