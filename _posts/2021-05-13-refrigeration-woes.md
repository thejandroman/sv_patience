If you recall we had anchored outside Georgetown, SC on Monday and were expecting to spend Wednesday and Thursday evening at the local marina. On Tuesday we woke up to a new problem. The refrigerator was not refrigerating.

Several thoughts went through our heads as we tried to assess the situation:

1. The compressor was running constantly. Presumably this meant the fridge was receiving power but just couldn't keep up. Perhaps it needed refrigerant?
1. The fridge is right next to the engine room. We had been running the engine hard for several days in a row. Maybe the fridge was getting too warm from the engine?
1. We noticed the batteries were low (12.2v) the previous night so we ran the engine for 15m to bring them back up to a good level (12.6v). So the batteries should be providing enough power.

In any case we now had several problems that needed resolution.

1. Most of our food had gone bad and would need to be disposed.
1. We needed a new fridge.
1. We needed some way of keeping food cold while we got a new fridge.

We started researching a new marine fridge ($$$) as well as super cold coolers. We also looked into what it would take to add refrigerant to the compressor lines. We would need to do another big provisioning run so we also inventoried what was salvageable and what was not. And while we were doing all this we noticed the batteries were at low voltage again.

Interesting.

So I fired up the engine again for 30m this time while we continued to research everything else. After 30m the voltage on the battery bank refused to go above 12.6v. We had tested these batteries at the marina overnight and had also tested our alternators ability to charge the batteries. It appears our tests weren't comprehensive and it looked like we might have bad batteries as well. These batteries were 5 and 6 years old so there was a strong possibility.

The question was: could our bad batteries be affecting our refrigerators ability to refrigerate? The internet seemed to believe it could. We devised a test. We were going to the marina on Wednesday. If we plugged into shore power, plugged in the battery charger, and the fridge started working then it was very likely we didn't have a bad fridge but just bad batteries. If it still didn't work then we had a bad fridge and should get the batteries tested.

That evening I called most of the local auto parts stores in town to see if they carried deep cycle marine AGM batteries, group 31. Every single one told me they didn't have either the battery group or the chemistry I needed. This meant if we did in fact have bad batteries it would be very difficult to find replacements in Georgetown. Myrtle Beach, further north, had more options but that was still several days away. We would have to find a short term solution like a cooler to get by for a week.

On Wednesday morning we pulled in to the marina without issue. We finished tying off and immediately plugged in the shore power to test things. While the charger was doing its thing we asked the dock hand about options. He told us about a local auto parts store with access to a nearby warehouse that might carry what we needed. They even delivered.

Back at the boat I called the auto parts store to find out that, yes, they had the batteries we needed and yes, they could have them at our boat the next day. Before placing the order we checked our fridge. It was working. Well. Things were cold. We ordered the batteries.

Today I received shipment of the batteries and had them installed in 30m. Everything seems to check out but the true test will be after a couple days at anchor. We'll get that chance tomorrow as we start making our way north through Myrtle Beach and into North Carolina.

Wish us luck.
